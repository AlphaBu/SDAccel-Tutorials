# Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully completed all the modules of this lab.

1. Created an SDAccel application from a basic C application.
1. Familiarized yourself with the reports generated during software and hardware emulation.
1. Explored various methods of optimizing your HLS kernel.
1. Learned how to set an OpenCL API command queue to execute out-of-order for improved performance.
1. Enabled your kernel to run on multiple compute units.
1. Used the HLS dataflow directive and explored how it affected your application.
1. Stacked multiple kernels to do additional processing.

# Next Steps

To take your SDAccel experience further, it is recommended to work through the other SDAccel Development Environment Tutorials.
